## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a software engineer who enjoys exploring code and building projects that reflect both curiosity and creativity. In my free time, I dive into open-source tools or personal-use applications and modify them to better fit my ideas and preferences. You'll find many of these implementations and experiments in my public repositories.

I value clean architecture and practical problem-solving, and I always welcome thoughtful collaboration and discussion with fellow developers. While I may not be constantly active due to real-life commitments, Iâ€™m always open to contributing where my skills and experience can make a meaningful impact.
